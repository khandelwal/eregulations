<h3> eRegulations </h3>

<p> 
    eRegulations is a web-based application that makes regulations easy to
    find, read and understand. It is a work in progress by the <a
    href="http://consumerfinance.gov">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>,
    and is a public domain work of the United States Government. 
</p>


<h3> Features </h3>

<p> Some of the main features of the tool are: </p>

<ul>

    <li> 
    <strong> Inline Interpretations. </strong>  Many regulation paragraphs have official
    interpretations that have traditionally been displayed at the end of the
    regulation, forcing readers to swap back and forth between the regulation
    content and interpretation at the end. eRegulations parses the
    intpretations for each paragraph, and displays them right under the
    paragraph/section being interpreted. 
    </li>

    <li> 
    <strong>Definitions.</strong> We highlight words that have been defined in the regulation,
    and the user can click on the word and see it's definition without
    scrolling to the part of the regulation that defines that word.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Bookmarks</strong> Each paragraph of a regulation can be
        bookmarked and retrieved individually. This allows users to pass these
        bookmarks around, sharing parts of the regulations. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Internal and external citations</strong> The parser parses out
        all internal and external citations in the regulation, and we display
        all citations as clickable links allowing easy navigation within a
        regulation, and externally to the relevant statutes, acts and other
        relevant material. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Search</strong>
        We provide the ability to search for phrases across various versions of
        a regulation. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Alternate versions of the regulations</strong>

        Regulations are evolving documents and are often displayed as changes
        to the base text. We present whole versions of regulations for each set
        of changes (We combine Final Rules that have a common effective date
        into a version). 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Effective regulation</strong> A user can also enter in a date,
        and retrieve the version of the regulation relevant at that point in time. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Section-by-section analysis</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Responsive Design</strong>.` The application design is
        responsive which means that it displays sensibly on small screens. 
    </li>

</ul>

<h3> Architecture </h3>

<p>
    There are three parts to the eRegulations application: a parser that
    converts regulation text into data (<a
    href="http://github.com/CFPB/regulations-parser">regulations-parser</a>),
    an API that hosts this data (<a
    href="http://github.com/eregs/regulations-core">regulations-core</a>), and
    the actual application itself which uses the data from the API to construct
    beautiful and usable regulations (<a 
    href="http://github.com/eregs/regulations-site">regulations-site</a>).
</p>

<p> One would typically run the parser against a regulation once (for each
version) to populate the API with all the necessary data. regulations-site
would then use regulations-core to as necessary to display regulations.  </p>

<h3>Technology</h3>

<p> regulations-parser is written in Python. </p>

<p> regulations-core is a MySQL backed Django application. </p>

<p>
The regulations-site front-end is a Backbone.js application nested within AMD
modules using Require.js. We also use a Grunt-based build system with Jasmine
for unit testing. On the back-end regulations-site is a Django application.
</p>
