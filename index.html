      <p>eRegulations is a web-based application that makes regulations easy to
      find, read and understand. It is a work in progress by the <a
      href="http://consumerfinance.gov">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>,
      and is a public domain work of the United States Government.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <p>Some of the main features of the tool are:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>
        <h4>Navigability.</h4>
        <p>While regulations are traditionally represented as 
        monolithic blocks of text, they contain a great deal of embedded structure. 
        eRegulations teases out that structure and uses it to present the text in a clean, 
        readable form.</p>
      </li>

      <li> 
        <h4> Inline Interpretations.</h4>
        <p>Many regulation paragraphs have official
        interpretations that have traditionally been displayed at the end of the
        regulation, forcing readers to swap back and forth between the regulation
        content and interpretation at the end. eRegulations parses the
        interpretations for each paragraph, and displays them right under the
        paragraph/section being interpreted.</p>
      </li>

      <li> 
        <h4>Definitions.</h4>
        <p>We highlight words that have been defined in the regulation,
        and the user can click on the word and see it's definition without
        scrolling to the part of the regulation that defines that word.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>Bookmarks.</h4>
        <p>Each paragraph of a regulation can be
        bookmarked and retrieved individually. This allows users to pass these
        bookmarks around, sharing parts of the regulations. </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>Internal and external citations.</h4> 
        <p>The parser parses out
        all internal and external citations in the regulation, and we display
        them as clickable links allowing easy navigation within a regulation, 
        and externally to statutes, acts and other relevant material. </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>Search.</h4>
        <p>We provide the ability to search for phrases across various versions of
        a regulation. </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>Alternate versions of the regulations.</h4>
        <p>Regulations are evolving documents and are often displayed as changes
        to the base text. We present whole versions of regulations for each set
        of changes (We combine Final Rules that have a common effective date
        into a version). </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>Effective regulation.</h4>
        <p>A user can also enter in a date,
        and retrieve the version of the regulation effective at that point in time. </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>Section-by-section analysis.</h4> 
        <p>The notices that compose a
        version of the regulation contain relevant analyses of the altered sections.
        We automatically pull that information out and make it accessible while
        reading the regulation text.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>Responsive Design.</h4> <p>The application design is
        responsive, adjusting to the device and screen size of the user.</p>
      </li>

    </ul>

  <section id="architecture">
  <h2>Architecture</h2>

    <p>
      There are three parts to the eRegulations application: a parser that
      converts regulation text into data (<a
      href="http://github.com/CFPB/regulations-parser">regulations-parser</a>),
      an API that hosts this data (<a
      href="http://github.com/eregs/regulations-core">regulations-core</a>), and
      a webapp which uses the data from the API to construct
      beautiful and usable regulations (<a 
      href="http://github.com/eregs/regulations-site">regulations-site</a>).
    </p>

    <p> One would typically run the parser against a regulation once (for each
    version) to populate the API with all the necessary data. regulations-site
    would then use regulations-core to as necessary to display regulations.  </p>
  </section> <!-- /#architecture-->

  <section id="technology">
    <h2>Technology</h2>

    <p>regulations-parser is written in Python.</p>

    <p>regulations-core is a Django and Haystack application.</p>

    <p>
    The regulations-site front-end is a Backbone.js application nested within AMD
    modules using Require.js. We also use a Grunt-based build system with Jasmine
    for unit testing. On the back-end regulations-site is a Django application.
